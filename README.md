**Title:** Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

**Description:**
This is a simple command-line-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid, with the goal of being the first to form a line of their respective symbols (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

**Features:**
- A user-friendly interface that allows two players to take turns playing the game.
- Clear visualization of the game board after each move.
- Detection of winning combinations and declaring the winner.
- Handling of ties when the board is full with no winner.
- Input validation to ensure players enter valid moves.

**How to Play:**
1. The game starts with player 'X' and alternates between 'X' and 'O' with each valid move.
2. Players enter their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol (e.g., "player X, enter the row in 0,1,2: ").
3. The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move and displays the result.
4. If a player wins or the game ends in a tie, it is announced, and the game concludes.

**To Run:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script using `python tic_tac_toe.py`.
